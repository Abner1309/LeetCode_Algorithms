You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
___
### (2) Add Two Numbers - Medium
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
___
### (3) Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters - Medium
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.
___
### (4) Median of Two Sorted Arrays - Hard
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
___
### (5) Longest Palindromic Substring - Medium

___
### (6) Zigzag Conversion - Medium
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R

And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);
___
### (7) Reverse Integer - Medium
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
___
### (8) String to Integer (atoi) - Medium
Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

    Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
    Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
    Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
    Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.

Return the integer as the final result.
___

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

    '.' Matches any single character.
    '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
___
### (11) Container With Most Water - Medium
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i^th line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

### (12) Integer To Roman - Medium
Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:
I - 1; V - 5; X - 10; L - 50; C - 100; D - 500; M - 1000.
Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a
decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:<br><br>
(1) If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, 
append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.<br><br>
(2) If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, 
for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).<br><br>
(3) Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot
append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.<br><br>
Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.
___
### (13) Roman To Integer - Easy
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.<br>

___
### (18) Four Sum - Medium
Given an array nums of n integers, return an array of all the unique quadruplets [nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]] such that:<br>

> 0 <= a, b, c, d < n <br>
> a, b, c, and d are distinct. <br>

An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

___
### (21) Merge Two Sorted Lists - Easy

___
### (25) Reverse Nodes in k-Group - Hard
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
___
### (26) Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array - Easy
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be k. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements k.

The first k elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index k - 1 can be ignored.
___
### (27) Remove Element - Easy
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

    Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
    Return k.
___
### (28) Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String - Easy
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
___
### (29) Divide Two Integers - Medium
Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be
truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: 
[−231, 231 − 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then return 231 - 1, and if the
quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.
___
### (30) Substring with Concatenation of All Words - Hard
You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.

A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

    For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.

Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.
___
### (31) Next Permutation - Medium
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

    For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

    For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
    Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
    While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.
___
### (32) Longest Valid Parentheses - Hard
Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.
___
### (33) Search in Rotated Sorted Array - Medium
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by 3 indices and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
___
### (34) Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array - Medium
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
___
### (35) Search Insert Position - Easy
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
___
### (36) Valid Sudoku - Medium
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

1. A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
2. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
___
### (37) Sudoku Solver - Hard
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
The '.' character indicates empty cells.
